Nexus to success is a web application that I was created to solve the recruiting problem. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a full stack web application.

Nexus to success is implemented using nodeJs, a JavaScript application platform. Within two weeks, we created a website that connects candidates with recruiters based on LinkedIn and Github profiles.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [LinkedIn API] for the recruiter and applicant data, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
